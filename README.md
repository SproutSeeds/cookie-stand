# Lab-8 Cookie Stand
I have created the ability to add on more stores through creating input boxes with an event listener attached to these inputs that creates new store isntances, funnelling the inputted information through the already created constructor function.

I also added a footer row that totals each hour block ending with a <th> element that states the totals of all of the hourly totals. 

mmmmm....salmon cookies... <3
