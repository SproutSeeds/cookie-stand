# Lab-8 Cookie Stand
I have created the ability to add on more stores through creating input boxes with an event listener attached to these inputs that creates new store isntances, funnelling the inputted information through the already created constructor function.

I also added a footer row that totals each hour block ending with a <th> element that states the totals of all of the hourly totals. 

**Wednesday-take2**
Added <fieldset> tag to html.

I went back to make sure decimal numbers are able to be inputted in the cookie average input tag by adding the step attribute and setting it to "0.1". 
I also made sure to change the type to "number" for all input boxes expecting numbers. 

Moved my funcCustomers and my funcCookies function to the render prototype to make sure it is only happening once per each instance created.

Gave my footer element an ID, giving me the ability to point to the footer and remove it by ID before each new instanced object is created. Then adding it back with the makeFooter method.

mmmmm....salmon cookies... <3
